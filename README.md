# ToDoList  Command Line  Tool App
This was the very first app I built. 

**Team: Zouf and Ayuna** 

Timeline: 1 week (6/27/15 - 2/7/15)

This ToDoList app is a command line tool app built in Objective-C for the final project of unit-0 of the [Access Code 2.2](http://www.c4q.nyc/accesscode) program at [C4Q](http://www.c4q.nyc/) (Coalition for Queens). The app was demoed in front of 30 people on July 2, 2015. 

Two months before that, I didn't know what coding is and have never considered a career in tech. A month before that, I used Git and GitHub for the first time in my life, and wrote my first line of code in C and Objective-C. At the end of the month I built my very first app with my teammate Zouf. 

While working on this app, I used git branches and separated objects into its own classes - something that we have not covered in class. I was looking for a more efficient way of working on a project (while not knowing what you are doing) other than working on the same master branch repo, so I learned using branches on my own and also introduced this workflow to my teammate. As for the objects and classes, I wasn't really sure what I was doing (since I wasn't familiar with the idea of classes yet) but I was trying to make my code more readable and mimicked the structure I saw in a Treehouse tutorial. 

I'm very sentimental of the things I do for the first time, like my first app, or my first trip abroad... 

I still have the keychain from that trip (it's been 15 years). It's a very unremarkable keychain (probably the cheapest one that I could afford). I bought it in a souvenir store in Helsinki. Whenever I meet a person from Finland (maybe like two times in my life), I tell them this story and show my keychain. :) 

I asked my classmate to film a video of my first app demo, so I could share it with my family, and so that I can keep a memory of it, too: https://youtu.be/xAwUkelIynA (The audio and video quality is terrible, but you can click CC for subtitles). 

By the way, here's my keychain from Helsinki
